My experience with this assignment went well. I was not faced with many challenges besides figuring out the proper terminology for the code within python in regards to testing. I feel like the requirements specification for this project was fair and the skeleton code provided was very useful for getting familiar with testing my code in python. The skeleton code was also very helpful in providing examples for the new tools that were used so I did not have much trouble with that. To determine that I had enough test cases, I made sure that every possibilitty for the output of a triangle type was tested. For example, I had a test for scalene, isoceles, and equilateral triangles. I also had separate tests for triangles that could be right or if the given values could not form a triangle.
